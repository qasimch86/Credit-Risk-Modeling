# Credit-Risk-Modeling

Backgound
GoodBank is a Canadian fin-tech that offers installment loans to its customers exclusively online. GoodBank prides itself in having the most automated account management system amongst all its competitors. As a result, all of GoodBank’s account handling decisions are made automatically; that is, no human ever touches an application from origination onwards. Try as it might, GoodBank does not always extend loans to customers that pay their loans back fully; some customers fall into arrears and some even stop paying their loans altogether. Once a customer stops paying a loan, GoodBank can try and collect. However, collection efforts are expensive (as they are quite human intervention) and often do not work. GoodBank uses models to select and send to collections the customers that are most likely to pay back. 
The decision to send a customer to collections is primarily based on the collections team’s ability to recover all or part of the outstanding balance of the loan. As such, the job of a collections model is to select the customers that are highly likely to make payments after they have been contacted by the collections team. These payments are called recoveries. The model makes this decision based on data provided by the customer at the time of application.
